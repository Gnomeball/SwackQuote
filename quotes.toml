Only, when I make a game I can share the experience with you; you can inhabit the same space, embody the same avatar, perhaps act on the same impulses, and — if serendipity allows — behold the same beautiful outcomes.

Through making and playing with games and other art, I hope to come to some deeper understanding of not the science of my brain, but the experience and meaning of being some specific person.

Look again at that dot.  That's here.  That's home.  That's us.  On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.  The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilisation, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.  Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.  Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.  Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.  In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.  There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate.  Visit, yes.  Settle, not yet.  Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience.  There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.  To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

So that I could imagine her crying for me
When she sees that she's lost her only friend.
But spring isn't even a thing:
Not even the flowers or green leaves return.
There are new flowers, new green leaves.
There are new balmy days.
Nothing returns, nothing repeats,
Because everything is new.

Coupled with the remarkable contingency of the evolution of the eucaryotic cell, and oxigenic photosyntesis.  Not to mention the half a billion years from the Cambrian explosion to the very recent emergence of Homo Sapiens and civilisation.  I think this implies that technological civilisasions, are stupendously rare, colossaly fortuitious, accidents, that happen on average, in much fewer than one in every 200 billion solar systems.

The way forward is to understand and accept that there are many opinions, but only one human civilisation, only one Nature, and only one science.  The collective goal of ensuring that there is never less than one human civilisation must surely override our personal prejudices.

It contains around 85 billion individual neurons, which is of the same order as the number of stars in an average galaxy.  But that doesn't begin to describe its complexity.  Each neuron is thought to make between 10,000 and 100,000 connections to other neurons, making the brain a computer way beyond anything our current technology can simulate.

More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For some reason, if a strag discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit, etc.  Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost".

There is no doubt that the grail of efficiency leads to abuse.  Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.  We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.

Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.  A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified.  It is often a mistake to make a priori judgments about what parts of a program are really critical, since the universal experience of programmers who have been using measurement tools has been that their intuitive guesses fail.  After working with such tools for seven years, I've become convinced that all compilers written from now on should be designed to provide all programmers with feedback indicating what parts of their programs are costing the most; indeed, this feedback should be supplied automatically unless it has been specificaly turned off.  After a programmer knows which parts of his routines are really important, a transformation like doubling up of loops will be worthwhile.

Clara sometimes asks me if I dream.

She always laughs at that. "But you're not going anywhere, you're just wandering about."

That's not true.  Not anymore.  I have a new destination.  My journey is the same as yours, the same as anyone's.  It's taken me so many years, so many lifetimes, but at last I know where I'm going.  Where I've always been going.  Home.  The long way around.

Dear Mr.  Swack,

It is with the utmost disappointment and dismay that I write to you today to express my profound dissatisfaction with the manner in which you have failed to provide Brian, our esteemed colleague, with the appropriate and requisite quantity of cheese.  As you are no doubt aware, cheese is a most indispensable commodity, particularly within the context of our organizational culture.  It serves as a staple for both sustenance and morale-boosting within the workplace, and it is therefore unacceptable that Brian should be deprived of its many benefits.  The inadequacy of your provision of cheese to Brian has been glaringly apparent, and it is most distressing to witness the deleterious effects that this has had upon his well-being.  His countenance has become sallow and despondent, and his productivity has diminished to an alarming degree.  It is a sad state of affairs indeed, and one that is entirely attributable to your neglectful conduct.

In light of these dire circumstances, I implore you to rectify this grievous situation with the utmost urgency.  I urge you to increase your allocation of cheese to Brian forthwith, and to do so in a manner that is both generous and expeditious.  Failure to do so would constitute a dereliction of duty on your part, and one that cannot be countenanced.  I trust that you will take this matter with the seriousness that it deserves, and that you will act swiftly to restore Brian to his former, cheese-fueled self.  The success and well-being of our organization depends on it.

Yours faithfully

- Compromise Foot: Equal to 2.14 feet, the average of one foot and one meter
- Stonehenge-Belgium Foot: Equal to 1.003 feet, or one one-millionth of the distance between Stonehenge and the edge of Belgium (which happens to be just over a million feet from Stonehenge)

Let's imagine what it would look like if you were speed-walking across the Earth's surface at 8 km/s.
To get a better sense of the pace at which you're traveling, let's use the beat of a song to mark the passage of time. Suppose you started playing the 1988 song by The Proclaimers, \"I'm Gonna Be (500 Miles).\" That song is about 131.9 beats per minute, so imagine that with every beat of the song, you move forward more than 2 miles.
In the time it took to sing the first line of the chorus, you could walk from the Statue of Liberty all the way to the Bronx.
You'd be moving at about 15 subway stops per second.
It would take about two lines of the chorus (16 beats) to cross the English Channel between London and France.
The song's length leads to an odd coincidence. The interval between the start and the end of \"I'm Gonna Be\" is 3 minutes and 30 seconds, and the ISS is moving at 7.66 km/s.
This means that if an astronaut on the ISS listens to \"I'm Gonna Be,\" in the time between the first beat of the song and the final lines... they will have traveled just about *exactly* 1000 miles.

This weapon of television could be useful."

There's this department of pure bureaucracy. It takes an hour to understand it and an hour to contact it. Every hundred years. A little Swacker comes and tries its luck on the department. And within time, the bureaucracy is chiselled away. The first second of eternity has passed.

You might think that's one hell of a long time.

Personally, I think that's one hell of a Swacker.

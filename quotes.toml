In space there is no gravity.  A compass points north.  Days get shorter in the winter and longer in the summer.  Total solar eclipses are rare.  At high noon, the Sun is directly overhead.  The Sun rises in the east and sets in the west.  The Moon comes out at night.  On the equinox there are 12 hours of day and 12 hours of night.  The Southern Cross is a beautiful constellation.

Look again at that dot.  That's here.  That's home.  That's us.  On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.  The aggregate of our joy and suffering, thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of civilisation, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals, every corrupt politician, every "superstar", every "supreme leader", every saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there — on a mote of dust suspended in a sunbeam.

The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena.  Think of the rivers of blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot.  Think of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how fervent their hatreds.

Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale light.  Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.  In our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.

The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life.  There is nowhere else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate.  Visit, yes.  Settle, not yet.  Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we make our stand.

It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building experience.  There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world.  To me, it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.

It contains around 85 billion individual neurons, which is of the same order as the number of stars in an average galaxy.  But that doesn't begin to describe its complexity.  Each neuron is thought to make between 10,000 and 100,000 connections to other neurons, making the brain a computer way beyond anything our current technology can simulate.

We must come to terms with being of no cosmic significance, and this means jettisoning our personal and collective egos and valuing what we have.

Science has forced us to look fixedly into an infinite universe, and its volume dilutes special pleading to a vanishingly small and pathetic whimper.  And yet what's left is better.  No monument to the gods is as magnificent as the story of our planet; of the origin and evolution of life on the rare Earth and the rise of a fledgling civilisation taking its first steps into the dark.  We stand related to every one of Darwin's endless, most beautiful forms, each of us connected at some branch in the unbroken chain of life stretching back 4 billion years.  We share more in common with bacteria than we do with any living things out there amongst the stars, should they exist, and they are more worthy of our attention.

A towel, it says, is about the most massively useful thing an interstellar hitchhiker can have.  Partly it has great practical value.  You can wrap it around you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapours; you can sleep under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal (such a mind-bogglingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you — daft as a brush, but very very ravenous); you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with it if it still seems to be clean enough.

More importantly, a towel has immense psychological value.  For some reason, if a strag discovers that a hitchhiker has his towel with him, he will automatically assume that he is also in possession of a toothbrush, face flannel, soap, tin of biscuits, flask, compass, map, ball of string, gnat spray, wet weather gear, space suit, etc.  Furthermore, the strag will then happily lend the hitch hiker any of these or a dozen other items that the hitch hiker might accidentally have "lost".  What the strag will think is that any man who can hitch the length and breadth of the galaxy, rough it, slum it, struggle against terrible odds, win through, and still knows where his towel is, is clearly a man to be reckoned with.

There is no doubt that the grail of efficiency leads to abuse.  Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered.  We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil.

Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.  A good programmer will not be lulled into complacency by such reasoning, he will be wise to look carefully at the critical code; but only after that code has been identified.  It is often a mistake to make a priori judgments about what parts of a program are really critical, since the universal experience of programmers who have been using measurement tools has been that their intuitive guesses fail.  After working with such tools for seven years, I've become convinced that all compilers written from now on should be designed to provide all programmers with feedback indicating what parts of their programs are costing the most; indeed, this feedback should be supplied automatically unless it has been specificaly turned off.  After a programmer knows which parts of his routines are really important, a transformation like doubling up of loops will be worthwhile.

quote = """
Dear Mr.  Swack,

It is with the utmost disappointment and dismay that I write to you today to express my profound dissatisfaction with the manner in which you have failed to provide Brian, our esteemed colleague, with the appropriate and requisite quantity of cheese.  As you are no doubt aware, cheese is a most indispensable commodity, particularly within the context of our organizational culture.  It serves as a staple for both sustenance and morale-boosting within the workplace, and it is therefore unacceptable that Brian should be deprived of its many benefits.  The inadequacy of your provision of cheese to Brian has been glaringly apparent, and it is most distressing to witness the deleterious effects that this has had upon his well-being.  His countenance has become sallow and despondent, and his productivity has diminished to an alarming degree.  It is a sad state of affairs indeed, and one that is entirely attributable to your neglectful conduct.

In light of these dire circumstances, I implore you to rectify this grievous situation with the utmost urgency.  I urge you to increase your allocation of cheese to Brian forthwith, and to do so in a manner that is both generous and expeditious.  Failure to do so would constitute a dereliction of duty on your part, and one that cannot be countenanced.  I trust that you will take this matter with the seriousness that it deserves, and that you will act swiftly to restore Brian to his former, cheese-fueled self.  The success and well-being of our organization depends on it.

Yours faithfully
